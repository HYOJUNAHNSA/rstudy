#3.13

### (a) Using the rnorm() function, create a vector, x, containing 100 observations drawn from a N(0, 1) distribution. This represents a feature, X.

``` {r}

set.seed(1)
a <- rnorm(100)
a

```
.

.

seed를 1로 set 한다. 


* rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)

  + If mean or sd are not specified they assume the default values of 0 and 1, respectively.


### (b) Using the rnorm() function, create a vector, eps, containing 100 observations drawn from a N(0, 0.25) distribution i.e. a normal distribution with mean zero and variance 0.25.

``` {r}

b <- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 0.25)
b

```
